I owe you an apology, I'm on my knees
Begging you to listen baby, won't you look at me
I know I get too fired up, I bring you down
Made our place a hot bed, so now you're staying out
I've been acting possessive lately, baby
I guess you might have too
Get some perspective with me if we wave, then we might get through
Imma make you remember
Before you forget
Our bodies tangled, how perfect they fit
No, i like your avengers, your pokemon kit
I'm sorry if you didn't see but i did
Imma make you remember
The way that it feels
All of the first-times like herd over heel
Take you back to November
Before you regret, before you forget
Imma make you remember
Imma make you remember
You owe me just a little time, to wrap my mind
Around the situation, baby won't you stay the night
I know you say you wanna go, you've had enough
But it feels electric when we accidentally touch
I've been acting possessive lately, baby
I guess you might have too
Get some perspective with me if we wave, then we might get through
Imma make you remember
Before you forget
Our bodies tangled, how perfect they fit
No, i like your avengers, your pokemon kit
I'm sorry if you didn't see but i did
Imma make you remember
The way that it feels
All of the first-times like herd over heel
Take you back to November
Before you regret, before you forget
Imma make you remember
Imma make you remember
Imma make you remember
No one stays two
But we should
And even though
It can get bad
It still feels good
Imma make you remember
Before you forget
Our bodies tangled, how perfect they fit
No, i like your avengers, your pokemon kit
I'm sorry if you didn't see but i did
Imma make you remember
The way that it feels
All of the first-times like herd over heel
Take you back to November
Before you regret, before you forget
Imma make you remember
Imma make you remember
Imma make you remember
Imma make you remember
Imma make you remember
